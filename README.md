# weFit_Front_End
 weFit is a fitness application that aims to provide free and open source fitness programming to it's users. This application uses the React.js library and is a multi-page application. It is comprised of both class and function-based components. In the upcoming refactor, I will be be replacing the hard coded axios calls with instances from an axiosCreate() component as well as utilizing interceptors to apply the JWT refresh-token.
